    "Ok so basically here is what the values mean, so r2 and mse are just that but the intercept is that if everything is a 0 and college isn't considered, the teacher would be a 2.3, which is around 2.5 which is what we want. For the colleges, it implies that, with all else equal, being in that college will affect the average score by that number. For the level of difficulty it means that a professors average score is -0.13 for every extra difficult level they add. FOr the would take again %, it means that for every increase in unit, the professors score will increase by 2.578. This is slightly misleading, since the real value would be 0.025786, because for example a 1% increase is really 0.01 * 2.57 not 1*2.57."
